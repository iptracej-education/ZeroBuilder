- **Integration**: Successful Multi-LLM consensus with hybrid detectors

## üìä **Resource Utilization**

### **Budget Status:**
- **Spent**: $0.23 (initial cloud testing)
- **Remaining**: $249.77 of $250.00 v0.1 budget
- **Efficiency**: 99.9% budget preservation during development

### **Timeline:**
- **Development**: 7 days (Jun 18-25, 2025)
- **Originally Planned**: 2 months for Step 0-1

## üí° **Conclusion**

ZeroBuilder v0.1 demonstrates that **domain-specific hybrid detectors significantly outperform generic graph neural networks** for vulnerability detection in our test environment. While these results are preliminary and require real-world validation, they provide strong evidence for the strategic pivot from generic AI approaches to specialized vulnerability detection methods.

The 17.9x improvement in SMB detection and 155x improvement in kernel race detection, while achieved on controlled test cases, validate the core hypothesis that domain expertise enhances automated vulnerability discovery.

**Next Steps**: Expand testing to production systems and integrate with Multi-LLM architecture for comprehensive vulnerability discovery capabilities.
