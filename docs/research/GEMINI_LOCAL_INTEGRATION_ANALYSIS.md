## üí° **Strategic Insight: Local Gemini Integration**

### **Current Multi-LLM Plan (Vast.ai):**
```
Planned Architecture:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CodeLlama Python 7B (25% weight) - Python security analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StarCoder 2 7B (25% weight) - C/kernel vulnerability validation  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DeepSeekCoder 6.7B (10% weight) - Pattern recognition
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Claude Code (40% weight) - Orchestration and consensus

Estimated Cost: $200-250 for validation of 12,843 vulnerabilities
```

### **Proposed Hybrid Architecture:**
```
Optimized Architecture:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Gemini (Local) - Multi-role validation and analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Specialized LLM (Vast.ai) - Single focused role
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Claude Code - Orchestration and final consensus

Estimated Cost: $50-100 (75% cost reduction)
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Proposed Architecture Options**

### **Option 1: Gemini-Heavy Hybrid** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```python
class GeminiHybridValidation:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gemini_local = GeminiLocalValidator()           # 60% weight
        self.starcoder_vastai = StarCoderValidator()         # 30% weight

        self.claude_orchestrator = ClaudeOrchestrator()      # 10% weight
    
    # No vast.ai deployment needed
```

**Advantages:**
- **95% cost reduction** ($10-15 vs $200-250)
