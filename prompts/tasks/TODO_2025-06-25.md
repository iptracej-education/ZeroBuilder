# ZeroBuilder TODO - June 25, 2025

**Project Status**: **v0.1 RELEASE FOCUS** üéØ  
**Current Phase**: Quality-First Development - Free Multi-LLM Integration  
**Philosophy**: Perfect the core before expanding scope  
**Budget**: Cost-optimized with free LLM models

## üß† **SESSION CONTINUITY BEST PRACTICES**

### **How to Continue ZeroBuilder Development with Claude**

#### **When Starting a New Claude Session**:
Always provide this context template:

```
Continue ZeroBuilder v0.1 development. Current status:

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- ZeroBuilder: Vulnerability discovery system with free Multi-LLM architecture
- Status: v0.1 quality focus (no feature creep until v0.1 is production-ready)
- Architecture: GAT (95.83% accuracy) + Free Multi-LLM consensus system

CURRENT SYSTEM:
- GAT Model: 95.83% accuracy on vulnerability detection
- Multi-LLM: Claude Code + CodeLlama Python + StarCoder 2 + DeepSeekCoder
- Infrastructure: Vast.ai A100 40GB ($0.20/hour, cost-optimized)
- Budget: $104/month (A100 + Claude Pro, no expensive APIs)

PLEASE READ THESE FILES:
- README.md (current system status and capabilities)
- prompts/tasks/TODO_2025-06-25.md (today's priorities)
- PLAN.md (overall strategy and timeline)
- Last completed: [specify what was accomplished]

IMMEDIATE CONTEXT:
- Yesterday's work: [brief summary]
- Today's priority: [current focus]
- Blockers: [any issues]
- Next steps: [immediate actions needed]

FOCUS: v0.1 quality development, free Multi-LLM deployment on A100
```

#### **Key Information to Always Include**:

1. **Project Identity**: "ZeroBuilder v0.1 vulnerability discovery system"

2. **Current Architecture**:
   - GAT vulnerability detection (95.83% accuracy)
   - Free Multi-LLM: Claude Code + CodeLlama Python + StarCoder 2 + DeepSeekCoder
   - Vast.ai A100 deployment ($0.20/hour)

3. **Philosophy**: v0.1 quality focus, no feature creep

4. **Files to Read**: Always point to current README.md, PLAN.md, TODO files

5. **Immediate Context**: What you're working on right now

#### **Documentation Files for Context**:
- **README.md**: System overview and current capabilities
- **PLAN.md**: Overall strategy and roadmap
- **prompts/tasks/TODO_[date].md**: Daily priorities and tasks
- **prompts/tasks/TASK_[date].md**: Detailed implementation plans
- **Code files**: Specific files you're working on

#### **Sample Session Starter**:
```
"Continue ZeroBuilder v0.1. I'm deploying free Multi-LLM models 
(CodeLlama Python + StarCoder 2 + DeepSeekCoder) on Vast.ai A100. 
Current status: A100 instance setup complete, need help with model 
deployment and integration. Please read README.md and today's TODO 
for full context."
```

### **Why This Matters**:
- **No Persistent Memory**: Each Claude session starts fresh
- **Context Rebuilding**: Need to reconstruct understanding quickly
- **Efficiency**: Avoid re-explaining the entire project
- **Continuity**: Maintain development momentum across sessions

### **Best Practices**:
1. **Keep Current Session Open**: Work in same session when possible
2. **Update Documentation**: Keep README.md and TODO files current
3. **Specific Context**: Include what you just accomplished
4. **Clear Next Steps**: State immediate priorities
5. **Reference Files**: Always point to relevant documentation
