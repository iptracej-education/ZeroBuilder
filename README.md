## üöÄ Project Overview

**Goal**: Build an end-to-end vulnerability discovery pipeline with:

- Guided fuzzing (GAT + RL)
- Dynamic tracing & taint analysis
- Global state inference
- Concurrency modeling
- Parallel SMT solving
- Automated exploit & patch synthesis
- CI/CD integration
- CVE submission & public open-source

**Target software**: Linux kernel, Chrome (libjpeg, libpng), SMB, HTTP

**Compute**:  
- Cheapest cloud services for A100 GPUs or a local server (32-core, 128GB RAM, 2x A100 GPUs) 
- AWS EKS 10 nodes (Steps 9, 12, 13)

**LLM Agents**:  
- Grok 3  
- DeepSeekCoder  
- GPT-4o

## üéØ Objective & Project Ambitions

**ZeroBuilder** is a modern deep vulnerability discovery pipeline ‚Äî designed to:

- Push the boundaries of automated vulnerability discovery beyond legacy systems such as DARPA CGC winners (Mayhem, Mechanical Phish) and Meta CaRE 2.0  
- Achieve full-spectrum vulnerability coverage ‚Äî from guided fuzzing to concurrency bugs, SMT-based exploit synthesis, and collaborative review with human  
- Apply the latest advances in:
  - Graph-based neural modeling (GATs, TGNs)
  - Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
  - Large Language Models (LLM-guided state inference and exploit generation)
  - Human-in-the-loop XAI interfaces for collaborative review  
- Demonstrate capability to find previously unknown bugs in high-value targets such as:
  - The Linux kernel (UAF, races, TOCTOU)
  - Chrome browser (libpng, libjpeg)
  - Complex protocols (SMB, HTTP/2)


**Technical Supremacy Targets (June 2027):**

| Target Area                      | Goal |
|----------------------------------|------|
| Fuzzing coverage                 | Surpass OSS-Fuzz for SMB/HTTP stateful targets |
| Kernel race condition discovery  | Detect previously unknown races in Linux kernel 6.x |
| Exploit synthesis                | Generate reliable PoCs bypassing ASLR, stack canaries |
| Patch synthesis                  | Generate functional, validated patches with CI/CD verification |
| End-to-end pipeline automation   | Public GitHub repo with 1-click install and full test suite |
| Learning feedback loops          | Achieve adaptive ML model retraining from bug discovery drift |

**Comparison Ambition:**  
While DARPA CGC and Meta CaRE 2.0 were multi-institution, funded programs ‚Äî ZeroBuilder aims to demonstrate that, by leveraging modern LLM agents (Grok 3, DeepSeekCoder, GPT-4o), a **single developer with discipline and compute** can surpass many 2015‚Äì2020 level approaches.
